# Cosmo Kramer Ideas Tool - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach: Retro-Modern Fusion

**Selected Approach:** Reference-based with 90s Seinfeld aesthetic + modern web app patterns (inspired by Linear's clarity + Notion's content organization + retro playfulness)

**Design Philosophy:** Channel Kramer's chaotic creativity through a surprisingly polished interface. Balance nostalgic 90s energy with contemporary UX patterns. The design should feel fun and accessible while maintaining professional functionality.
